# gwf-torque-backend

This plugin adds support the TORQUE backend in the [gwf](http://gwf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) workflow mananger. The simplest way to install it is by using conda:

```
$ conda install -c micknudsen gwf-torque-backend
```

I have very limited experience with TORQUE, and implementing this plugin involved a lot of trial and error. Let me know if it doesn't work as expected for you.
